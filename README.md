# AI_powered_workflow_automation
I developed a complete email support ticket triage system that automatically classifies and prioritizes incoming customer emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The core of the system is a Flask API connected to Hugging Face’s DistilBERT model, which analyzes the email content to determine the ticket category, like Technical Issue or General Inquiry, and assigns a priority level—High, Medium, or Low.To make the API easily accessible, I used ngrok to expose it publicly and integrated it with Zapier. This allows automated creation and logging of tickets in Google Sheets without manual intervention. The automation significantly reduces the time spent on manual triaging, speeds up response times, and helps keep ticket tracking organized.The whole solution supports real-time AI-powered decision-making, includes error handling, and grows better with user feedback. This project highlights my skills in AI integration, API development, cloud tools, and workflow automation, all of which contribute to improving customer service efficiency and satisfaction.Technologies used include Python, Flask, Hugging Face Transformers, ngrok, Zapier, Google Sheets, and REST APIs.
